# NottsJS Talks
A repo for organising talk proposals and discussing talks with speakers

## Talk Format

- Each event has up to 2 speaker slots available.  
- Each talk is allocated 20 minute, however this can be altered on a per-case basis.

## How
Its simple. [Open an issue](https://github.com/nottsjs/speakers/issues/new) to submit a talk.  

Please structure the issue as following:

- Title: [Talk Title]
- Body: [Abstract of your talk]

If you are looking for feedback on your talk or have additional question, reply to your issue with  **extra comments** stating your questions but please keep them off the body of the original issue text itself

## Confirmation
- Once your issue is assigned a milestone, it has been approved and confirmed.  
- Check the milestone date for confirmation of the event date.

## After the event
Please tweet a url to your slides and put the link in your proposal as a comment.

Thanks,
